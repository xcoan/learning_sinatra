# Learning Sinatra

## About
I decided to try and learn the Sinatra framework.

I figured the best way to do so was by making a tribute to the Sultan of Swoon himself.


## How to Run
1. Make sure you've run `bundle`
2. `rackup -p 3000`
3. Visit localhost:3000 in your browser (or whatever port your specified!)
